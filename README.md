## Backgrounds and Gradients

This project is to mimic the [Apple.com homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) from March 2014. It's a project to hone skills in using background images and using CSS gradients to style the navbar whilst mimicking one of the most design-forward companies in the world.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
